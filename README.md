# Event Management System - SQL Server Implementation

This project implements a basic Event Management System using Microsoft SQL Server 2022. It includes scripts for both Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations.

## Project Structure

* DDL.sql: This file contains the SQL statements for creating all of the schema for the event management system.
* DML.sql: This file contains the SQL statements for populating the database with sample data and performing various data manipulation operations.

## Instructions

**Prerequisites:**

* Microsoft SQL Server 2022 installed

**Steps:**

1. **Execute DDL Script:** Open the DDL.sql file in a SQL Server Management Studio query window and execute the script. This will create the necessary database, tables, columns, constraints, schema, index, sequence, view, stored-procedure, user-defined-function, and trigger for the event management system.
2. **Execute DML Script:** Open the DML.sql file in a separate query window and execute the script. This will populate the tables with sample data and demonstrate various DML operations like insertions, updates, and deletions.

## Additional Notes

* This project serves as a basic example and can be further extended to incorporate additional functionalities for a complete event management system.
* Modify the script content as needed to suit your specific requirements.
